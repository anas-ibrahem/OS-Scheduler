## **round robin** 

>Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum). If a process doesnâ€™t finish in that time, it's placed back in the queue

here the quantum is 3 in this test case:

- process 1 starts running at time 10 for 3 seconds
- process 2 runs and finishes execution at timestamp 14 
- process 3 runs at timestamp 14 for 3 seconds and gets enqueued back at the end of the circular queue
- process 1 reruns at timestamp 17 from, finishes at timestamp 20 and gets enqueued at the end of the circular queue
- process 4 arrives at timestamp 20
- process 3 reruns till timestamp 23
- process 4 starts running and runs at 26 
- process 1 again at timestamp 26
- context switching between 1 , 3, and 4 until they all finish

## **highest priority first** 

>it chooses the process with highest priority and runs it until it finishes (non preemptive)

order of running 
- process 1  
- process 4 
- process 3
- process 2 
notices in HPF how process 2 was executed last

## **shortest remaining time next** 
>it always chooses the process which has smallest remainint time and context switch to it 

- process 1 runs for one second
- process 2 runs and finishes at timestamp 12
- process 3 runs until it finishes at timestamp 22 
- process 1 runs and finishes at timestamp 36
- then finally process 4 runs 

notice how process 1 had to wait for 10 more seconds to start execution
